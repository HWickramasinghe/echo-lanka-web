The admin panel is designed to facilitate efficient management of the platform, enabling administrators to manage users, oversee product listings, add, view, update, and delete products, handle customer inquiries, and perform other critical tasks with ease. The separation of the customer interface and the admin panel through distinct logins enhances security, ensuring that sensitive administrative tasks are protected from unauthorized access.Overall, Echo-Lanka aims to provide an unparalleled shopping experience by leveraging the latest web technologies and best practices in web development, setting a new standard in the e-grocery retail industry.
